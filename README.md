## Summary
This script can be used for other elections with a couple more modifications, that's if we want to breakdown the information even further, for instance:
  1- We can break down what metod was used to vote (machine voting, ballot, online, etc).
  
  2- Another modification would be breaking down the percentage of votes agaisnt each candidate in every county.
